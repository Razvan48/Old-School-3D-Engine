# Old-School-3D-Engine

&emsp; This is a game engine inspired by early 1990's first-person shooters, such as Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and Doom (1993). <br/>
&emsp; Levels are easily-customisable in the form of 2D arrays, yet they are rendered in 3D using RayCasting algorithms. <br/>
&emsp; Collision detection and resolution are implemented. <br/>
