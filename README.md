# Old-School-3D-Engine | _C++, OpenGL, RayCasting Algorithm, Sprites_

&emsp; This is a game engine inspired by early 1990's first-person shooters, such as Wolfenstein(1992) and Doom(1993). <br/>
&emsp; Levels are easily-customisable in the form of 2D arrays, yet they are rendered in 3D using RayCasting. <br/>
&emsp; Collision detection and resolution are implemented. <br/>
&emsp; All sprites (the barrel for example) and textures (the walls) are made from scratch. <br/>
