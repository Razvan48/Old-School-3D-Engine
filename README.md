# Old-School-3D-Engine | _C++, OpenGL, RayCasting Algorithm, Sprites_

&emsp; This is a recreation of the MineSweeper game using Python and Pygame module. <br/>
&emsp; All sprites (including buttons, flags and bombs) are made from scratch. <br/>

**Controls:** <br/>

&emsp; Left-Click for pressing any button (back, reset and quit buttons) and for revealing a square. <br/>
&emsp; Right-Click for placing a flag on a square (or for undoing this action if the flag has already been placed). <br/>
